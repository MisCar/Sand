## Features

### Design

Sand supports both light and dark mode and one of its goals is to have a good looking user-interface.

### Ease of Use

Sand resembles Shuffleboard so you don't have to get used to different things. Some familiar aspects include the NetworkTables tree view, the drag and drop & grid layout,

## Getting Started

Simply get the appropriate installer for your OS from the [latest release](https://github.com/MisCar/Sand/releases). This should be a lightweight setup for the application which will automatically prompt you for updates when they are available.

### Connecting to the Robot

In the app settings panel of the Edit tab (with the paste brush icon), enter your robot address. This should be something like `10.TE.AM.2`. Hit save and restart the app, and then you should be connected. Note that Sand uses NT4 so it can only connect to WPILib 2023+ robots.

## Caveats

- While performance seems to be good in our limited testing, and we do try to keep performance as good as possible, it is not a main goal of the project (and indeed React, Mantine, and the code structure reflect quite a bit of room for improvement). Contributions are welcome to address this.
- Web security is quite a complicated topic, and in order to view camera streams Sand must enable unsecure HTTP traffic. This means you should avoid putting non-camera URLs in the Camera widget.

## Developing

- Clone the repository
- Follow the instructions for [tauri and rust](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites)
